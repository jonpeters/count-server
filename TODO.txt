- add index to username on users collection

- add remaining joi endpoint validations

- fill in gaps in time-series data to get a truer graph; e.g. the graph end-bound is only the latest data in the
system but probably should be "now"

- add tests
    * create well-defined data set
    * floor start date and ceiling end date
    * hour vs day
    * history length
    * range accuracy
    * test all end-point operations (create, query-by for different users, etc)

- add readme / quick-start

- add history

// is provided as the start time, truncate it to 11:00:00,
+    // adjusting the start time to account for history length
+    start = (start - (start % groupByValue)) - (groupByValue * req.query["history_length"]);
